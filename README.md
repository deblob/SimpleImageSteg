# SimpleImageSteg 
 A simple tool that lets you hide messages in bitmaps.  
 Inspirect by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWEXCYQKyDc) by Computerphile.

 Since I mainly coded this to try out this cool method of hiding stuff in images, the code is not yet very well written and not very optimized.  
 Maybe I will get back to it in the future.
 
 
# Issues
 - The entire program is written in Program.cs, which really isn't very good form. I'm planning on making this into a command-line tool.
 - In the decoded text file there will be a lot of ? characters. (this should be an easy fix once I get around to it)
 - There is no direct support for hiding anything other than text yet.
 - I haven't done a lot of testing yet, so there might still be some crashes.
 - And surely many more.
